(:contentboxend:)

''AI in the News'' is a AAAI service to alert readers to current news articles in the field of AI that appear in various online news sources. An agent known as NewsFinder periodically crawls the web looking for AI-related news articles. The collection of articles is first filtered to select only those that mention at least one of many key terms related to AI. Then duplicate articles are detected using a semantic similarity metric, and filtered out. Finally, each article is categorized using a bank of support vector machines, one for each of the 19 topics in AITopics; articles matching no topics are also filtered out of the collection. The resulting collection is published on this web page, in the %newwin%[[http://www.aaai.org/cgi-dada/mail.cgi | AI-Alert email list]], and in our [[#feeds | various topic-oriented and aggregate RSS feeds]].

Details about NewsFinder can be found on the [[AINewsProcedure |  '''NewsFinder''']] wiki page.

Note: Placement of an item inside AINews is dependent on that item's tags. Specifically, if an item is tagged with 'video' or if it is in the AIVideos/ page group, it will get placed in the Videos section. If an item is tagged with 'audio' or if it is in the AIAudio/ page group, it will get placed in the Audio section. Otherwise it will get placed in the general news headlines section. Tags also determine which RSS feeds the item goes in. For example, an item tagged with "speech" will get inserted into the "speech" RSS feed.
