(:contentboxend:)

''AI in the News'' is a AAAI service to alert readers to current stories about AI that appear in various news sources.  An AI program, NewsFinder, crawls the web to collect stories that mention a few key terms, like "artificial intelligence" or "robot", parses them, scores them with respect to likely interest to readers, and publishes the highest scoring stories here.  NewsFinder uses a Support Vector Machine that has been trained to classify the interestingness of stories (and is retrained frequently from readers' feedback) to score every story, then adjusts the scores up or down using knowledge of words and phrases that indicate more or less interest.

We hope you will contribute your own ratings. If a story is not relevant to ''AI in the News'' readers, it warrants a zero. Otherwise, use the 1-5 scale to rate how relevant and interesting a story is to readers. Click on the Rate button to submit your rating.

Stories are selected and published to ''AI in the News'' by the [[AINewsProcedure |  '''NewsFinder''']] program.

Note: Placement of an item inside AINews is dependent on that item's tags. Specifically, if an item is tagged with 'video' or if it is in the AIVideos/ page group, it will get placed in the Videos section. If an item is tagged with 'audio' or if it is in the AIAudio/ page group, it will get placed in the Audio section. Otherwise it will get placed in the general news headlines section. Tags also determine which RSS feeds the item goes in. For example, an item tagged with "speech" will get inserted into the "speech" RSS feed.
